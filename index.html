                        Prediction</a></h3>
                <p>I am currently working on this project to predict the probability of cardiac arrest.
                    I'm dealing with certain issues with the dataset, however, I was able to learn some fundamental topics such as ETL pipeline.
                    Other tools/skills used :  PostgreSQL, Python, numpy, matplotlib, SparkPlus

                <ul>
                    <li>Solar power is recognized as a key component of a green future, but excessive solar energy
                        generation needs proper balancing to prevent damage to existing power sources.</li>
                    <li>Worked on the concept of the "duck curve," which represents the power required from non-solar
                        sources during peak solar power generation.</li>
                    <li>Focuses on the calculation of the duck curve by predicting solar power generation using machine
                        learning techniques.</li>
                    <li>Utilizes weather data parameters such as temperature, humidity, and wind temperature to predict
                        solar output.</li>
                    <li>Enables efficient allocation of power demand to non-solar sources based on solar power
                        generation trends.</li>
                    <li>Analyzes the typical pattern of solar power peaking during the daytime, followed by a sharp drop
                        in non-solar demand and a steady increase as the sun sets.</li>
                    <li>Provides insights into adjusting non-solar sources for efficient power generation based on the
                        duck curve.</li>

                        corroborates findings with official sources.</li>
                    <li>Plots the duck curve for VIT Chennai and extends the model to observe GHI patterns in other
